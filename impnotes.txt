MOST URGENT THINGS TO DO:
1. Improve splash screen design and implement it everywhere
2. Check the re-renders due to useEffect after login and sign up, its a little glitchy
3. Write in all the journal related jobs to mainStore and make the index of (main) cleaner
4. Find a way of animating the loading of the journals, abhi they just show up adruptly
5. I dont want to access journals every time the main page renders or focuses, I want it in async storage, and only update it when a journal is added or removed.

NOTES:
Deleting journals and deleting entries hum baad mei karenge (1:28:00 in video)
Zustand Basics 2:35:00 in video
Complete signup workflow 2:49:35 in video
image saving and all for entry saving in video 3:45:28 se and even at 4:00:00 for backend

NEXT STEPS:
1. Journals accessing from database, adding journals to database
2. Text Editor refine UX
3. Add so that image can be inserted
4. Archive based on current journal (main store file se)
5. Chat GPT AI integration to auto generate title
6. feature to change title
7. Profile and settings page

We are using zustand to connect backend to frontend, and render.com to deploy our api
cronjobs is used to send a get requesnt every 14 minutes to render.com so that aur api doesnt go like offline
